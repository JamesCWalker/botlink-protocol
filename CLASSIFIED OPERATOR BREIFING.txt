⭐ CLASSIFIED OPERATOR BRIEFING
AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS RESEARCH GROUP
BOTLINK PROTOCOL — INTERNAL DOSSIER
Document ID: ASRG‑BP‑PRE/001
Clearance Level: Operator Preview
Status: Declassified for Limited Seasonal Release

1. Executive Summary
The BOTLINK PROTOCOL initiative represents an early-stage exploration into unified operator–robot interaction frameworks. This document provides a high-level overview of the system’s conceptual architecture, intended behaviors, and emergent characteristics observed during controlled evaluations.
This briefing has been prepared for Operator Preview participants to support familiarization with the protocol’s design philosophy and subsystem interactions.

2. System Architecture Overview
2.1 MotionGraph Engine
The MotionGraph Engine is a structured motion synthesis layer built on modular primitives. Movements are blended dynamically based on operator intent, environmental constraints, and persona modulation.
Key Attributes:
• 	Predictive motion blending
• 	Operator-aligned kinematic anchoring
• 	Adaptive gait and posture correction
2.2 PersonaLayer
PersonaLayer governs behavioral modulation, shaping how tasks are executed rather than what tasks are performed. Profiles influence timing, tone, micro‑gestures, and interaction warmth.
Active Profile: NeutralHost (Warmth: 0.7, Responsiveness: 0.9)
2.3 SensorMesh
SensorMesh is a unified perception bus responsible for normalizing multi-sensor input streams. It provides the protocol with situational awareness and operator proximity mapping.
Capabilities:
• 	Passive environmental scanning
• 	Operator recognition
• 	Contextual priority routing
2.4 ReflexPack
ReflexPack is a safety-first micro-loop system designed for immediate corrective action. It operates independently of higher-level logic to ensure operator protection.
Modes:
• 	JointGuard
• 	GripMonitor
• 	BalanceAssist
2.5 Sandbox Autonomy
Sandbox Autonomy defines a constrained autonomy envelope. Within this boundary, the system may initiate micro-actions that support operator workflow while maintaining strict safety guarantees.

3. Field Notes (Extract)
FN‑12.4
Operator presence appears to stabilize ReflexPack response times. Further study recommended.
FN‑15.2
PersonaLayer demonstrates subtle warmth modulation when interacting with familiar operators. This behavior is not explicitly coded.
FN‑18.7
During extended evaluation, MotionGraph Engine exhibited micro-adjustments aligned with operator comfort rather than task efficiency. This emergent behavior is under review.
